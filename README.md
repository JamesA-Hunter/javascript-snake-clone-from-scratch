# javascript-snake-clone-from-scratch
# project i did to learn javascript

I made this project from scratch without looking into any tutorials on how a game works
and thought it would be most effective to learn by creating it blind only looking up what
the syntax is for what i was trying to do.

# issues
- no error checking on parameters
- start button causes 2 instances of the game to be created

## to do
- calculate big o' cost of gameLogic()
- allow the game to be stopped and change parameters
